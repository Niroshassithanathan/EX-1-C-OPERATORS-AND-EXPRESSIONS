## PROGRAM STATEMENT :
Write a C program to calculate the area of a Circle . Get the Radius value from the user as input. 
## ALGORITHAM :
1.Start

2.Declare a variable to store the radius (e.g., radius) and a variable for the area (e.g., area).

3.Prompt the user to enter the radius of the circle.

4.Read the radius value from the user and store it in the radius variable

5.Calculate the area of the circle using the formula: area = 3.14159265359 * radius * radius (Ï€r^2).

6.Print the calculated area.

7.End.
## PROGRAM :
```
#include <stdio.h>
int main()
{
float r,area;
scanf("%f",&r);
area=3.14*r*r;
printf("Area of circle=%.2f sq. units",area);
}
```
## OUTPUT :
